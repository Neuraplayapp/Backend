    "Address logged errors before deploying to production"
  ],
  "nextSteps": [
    "1. Review failed tests and investigate root causes",
    "2. Fix identified issues and re-run tests",
    "3. Verify fixes don't break other functionality",
    "4. Update documentation with any changes",
    "5. Share results with development team"
